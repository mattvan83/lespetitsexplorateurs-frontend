# Description

Les petits explorateurs is a mobile application developed as a Minimum Viable Product as part of an end-of-course project for the "Web and Mobile Application Designer & Developer" program at La Capsule. 

The app was born out of a personal need, as a parent, to find activities for your child in the surrounding villages. After all, there are plenty of activities out there, but you need to know about them.

In small towns and villages, it's sometimes difficult for parents to find out about the various family activities available. Town halls don't have all the information on their websites, and associations don't have websites but Facebook pages. 
The problem is that if you don't know an association, you don't know its Facebook page either. The best way to find out about existing activities is by word-of-mouth. But when you've just moved in, you don't have access to information.

And once the kinship network has been created, a lot of sharing takes place via WhatsApp messaging, so links are easily lost in the conversation and you have to scroll before you can find them again.
For their part, associations find it hard to communicate their workshops to as many people as possible (information is drowned out by social networks). They send out emails that only reach those who are already members.

As a parent, these problems have given rise to the idea of a digital word-of-mouth service for family activities. The aim is to enable parents not only to search for activities close to home, but also to list them. It's a collaborative tool by parents for parents.
